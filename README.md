# Hello, I'm Oscar Molnar ðŸ‘‹

I am a dedicated Software Developer based in Coventry, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§.

I bring my expertise to the classroom as a visiting lecturer in C++ programming for games at Birmingham City University.

Prior to my current roles, I served as a Visualisation Engineer for Jaguar Land Rover, and also had an amazing journey with Brandwatch.

I find joy in writing code, tinkering with *nix computers, immersing myself in video games and capturing the world through photography.

My fascination extends to all things science-related. If you share a similar interest or just want to geek out, feel free to get in touch with me ðŸ’».
