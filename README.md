# Hey there, I'm Oscar Molnar ðŸ‘‹

I'm a tech enthusiast and software developer based in Coventry, UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, with a passion for writing code and solving problems.

By day, I channel my skills as a Senior Software Engineer at [Glean](https://glean.co), diving into projects that keep me on the cutting edge of tech. 

In a past life, I had the privilege of teaching as a visiting lecturer in C++ game programming at Birmingham City Universityâ€”thereâ€™s nothing quite like sharing knowledge and inspiring the next generation of game developers.

Previously, I engineered immersive visual experiences at Jaguar Land Rover and tackled challenging projects at Brandwatch. Every role has been a quest of its own, adding layers to my developer skillset and fueling my passion for tech.

Beyond work, I'm all about tinkering with *nix systems, taking on coding side quests, leveling up in video games, and capturing the beauty of the world through my camera lens. Science fascinates me, and I'm always down to talk shopâ€”whether it's tech, physics, or the latest in game development.
